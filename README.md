## Introduction

A personal project I made to get my hands wet with React Router, React Bootstrap, and get a bit more familiar with APIs. 

Simply use the search bar to search for recipes and select the one you're interested in. The application will display an ingredient list, nutrition info, and a link to the preparation instructions for the recipe. The recipe data is from the Edamam Recipe Search API (https://www.edamam.com/).
